            An electric vehicle (EV) is one that operates on an electric motor, 
            instead of an internal-combustion engine that generates power by 
            burning a mix of fuel and gases. Therefore, such as vehicle is seen 
            as a possible replacement for current-generation automobile, in order 
            to address the issue of rising pollution, global warming, depleting 
            natural resources, etc. Though the concept of electric vehicles has 
            been around for a long time, it has drawn a considerable amount of 
            interest in the past decade amid a rising carbon footprint and other 
            environmental impacts of fuel-based vehicles.

            In India, the first concrete decision to incentivise electric vehicles 
            was taken in 2010. According to a Rs 95-crore scheme approved by the 
            Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE), the government announced 
            a financial incentive for manufacturers for electric vehicles sold in 
            India. The scheme, effective from November 2010, envisaged incentives 
            of up to 20 per cent on ex-factory prices of vehicles, subject to a 
            maximum limit. However, the subsidy scheme was later withdrawn by the 
            MNRE in March 2012.

            In 2013, India unveiled the 'National Electric 
            Mobility Mission Plan (NEMMP) 2020' to make a major shift to electric 
            vehicles and to address the issues of national energy security, vehicular 
            pollution and growth of domestic manufacturing capabilities. Though the 
            scheme was to offer subsidies and create supporting infrastructure for 
            e-vehicles, the plan mostly remained on papers. While presenting the 
            Union Budget for 2015-16 in Parliament, then finance minister Arun 
            Jaitley announced faster adoption and manufacturing of electric 
            vehicles (FAME), with an initial outlay of Rs 75 crore. The scheme was 
            announced with an aim to offer incentives for clean-fuel technology 
            cars to boost their sales to up to 7 million vehicles by 2020.

            In 2017, Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari made a statement showing 
            Indiaâ€™s intent to move to 100 per cent electric cars by 2030. However, 
            the automobile industry raised concerns over the execution of such a plan. 
            The government subsequently diluted the plan from 100 per cent to 30 per cent.

            In February 2019, the Union Cabinet cleared a Rs 10,000-crore programme under 
            the FAME-II scheme. This scheme came into force from April 1, 2019. The main 
            objective of the scheme is to encourage a faster adoption of electric and hybrid 
            vehicles by offering upfront incentives on purchase of electric vehicles and 
            also by establishing necessary charging infrastructure for EVs.
